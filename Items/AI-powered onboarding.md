## Idea

Use AI to personalize the onboarding experience. Ask users a few questions, then generate a customized dashboard setup and suggested workflows.

## Problem It Solves

New users often don't know where to start. Generic onboarding doesn't address their specific needs. AI can bridge the gap between "blank slate" and "productive setup."

## Potential Impact

- **Effort:** High
- **Value:** High

## Next Steps

1. Research existing AI onboarding implementations
2. Prototype with OpenAI API
3. Test with 5 beta users

## Notes

Could be a major differentiator. Save for post-MVP phase.
